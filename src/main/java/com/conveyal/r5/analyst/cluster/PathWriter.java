 *
 * This used to write one path for every departure minute / MC draw at every destination, which the client
 * filtered down to only a few for display, but that leads to huge files and a lot of post-processing.
 *
 * Users may be surprised to see an uncommon path that happens to be associated with the median travel time, so we now
