         * $4.50 - two subway fares - because there is no behind-the-gates transfer between Riverside and Newton Center.

         * At Cleveland Circle, the transfer allowances from the two services are equal* so the train route could dominate the
         * bus route, even though the bus route yields a cheaper overall route. To prevent this, we consider the train
